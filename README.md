Visioin 

When I began to think of how I would design this game I instantly drew a basic layout like I used to when I was in school playing with friends. I knew instantly I wanted to keep my design simple but effective, I set up my template first and then went onto the behind the scenes of how the app would be able to run. 

HTML --> CSS --> javaScript --> CSS

Technologies Used
 - JavaScript
 - HTML
 - CSS + Animation


Application requirements
The app must:

 - Render a game in the browser
 - Switch turns between more than one player (2 player playing on a single computer)
 - Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
 - Design logic for a draw game & visually display when there is a draw
 - Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
 - Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
 - Deploy the game online
 - Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
 - Known Issues
 - The app is not fully responsive. Optimised for desktop (min-height: 800px, min-width: 1200px).
 
Improvements

 - Refactor the If..else if..else conditional statements and package them into reusable functions
 - Having a modal to anouce the winner but also to put in players names to make it more personable 
 - Create a 1 Player feature (player 2 is the computer)
 - Create a games tracker (how many wins/draws/total games)
 - I personally would like to have more of wireframe and plane inplace for myself next time
